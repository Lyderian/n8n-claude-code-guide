## Prerequisites

You'll need three things:

1. **n8n Instance** - Self-hosted or cloud
2. **AI Terminal Tool** - Claude Code (recommended), Gemini CLI, or Codex
3. **Coffee** - That's just the rules

### Claude Code Requirements

- Requires an [Anthropic Pro subscription](https://claude.ai/pro) or API access
- Can be installed on any Linux-based machine (including Mac, Windows WSL)

### Where to Install Claude Code

You can install Claude Code on:

| Location | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Same VPS as n8n | Simple setup, same machine | Resource sharing |
| Dedicated Ubuntu server | Best performance, local file access | Additional infrastructure |
| Raspberry Pi | Low cost, always on | Limited resources |
| Hostinger VPS | Cloud-based, easy setup | Monthly cost |

                                     │  Your Context    │
                                     └──────────────────┘
```

The magic? **SSH**. That's it. n8n uses the SSH node to remotely execute Claude Code commands on your server.

## Setup Guide

### 1. Install Claude Code

On your Linux server (Ubuntu example):

```bash
# Install Node.js (if not installed)
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Install Claude Code globally
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Verify installation
claude --version

# Authenticate (follow prompts)
claude auth
```

### 2. Configure n8n SSH Credentials

1. In n8n, add an **SSH** node to your workflow
2. Click **Create New Credential**
3. Fill in your server details:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Host** | Your server IP (e.g., `10.77.14.30` or public IP) |
| **Port** | `22` (default SSH) |
| **Username** | Your SSH username |
| **Authentication** | Password or Private Key |
| **Password/Key** | Your credentials |

4. Click **Save** - Look for "Connection tested successfully"

### 3. Test the Connection

First, test with a basic command:

```bash
hostname
```

If that works, test Claude Code:

```bash
claude --version
```

You should see the Claude Code version in the output.

---

## Basic Usage

### Simple Claude Command

Use the `-p` (print) flag for headless mode - send a prompt and get a response:

**SSH Node Command:**
```bash
claude -p "Why do pugs look so weird?"
```

The `-p` flag puts Claude in "print mode" - it processes your prompt and returns the result without interactive input.

### Adding Context (Working Directory)

Give Claude access to your project files by changing directory first:

**SSH Node Command:**
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project && claude -p "Is this video going to be any good?"
```

Claude will read files in that directory to inform its response. This is the power - **context from your local files**.

### Using Skills and Agents

Put Claude in "dangerous mode" to enable tool use and agent deployment:

**SSH Node Command:**
```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p "Use your unifi skill to check wifi status, network performance, and security. Deploy three agents, one for each task. Keep response under 2000 characters."
```

This enables Claude to:
- Use installed skills (like UniFi, Slack, etc.)
- Deploy multiple agents in parallel
- Execute code and scripts
- Access APIs and external services

---

## Session Management

The real power comes from maintaining conversations across multiple n8n executions.

### Creating a Session ID

Add a **Code** node before your SSH node to generate a UUID:

**Code Node (JavaScript):**
```javascript
const uuid = 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'.replace(/[xy]/g, function(c) {
  const r = Math.random() * 16 | 0;
  const v = c == 'x' ? r : (r & 0x3 | 0x8);
  return v.toString(16);
});

return [{ json: { sessionId: uuid } }];
```

**SSH Node Command:**
```bash
claude -p "How many access points are up right now?" --session-id {{ $json.sessionId }}
```

### Resuming Sessions

To continue a conversation, use the `-r` (resume) flag with the same session ID:

**SSH Node Command (Follow-up):**
```bash
claude -r {{ $('Code').item.json.sessionId }} -p "Why is one of them down?"
```

The `-r` flag resumes the previous session, so Claude remembers the context of your earlier questions.

## Advanced Workflows

### Slack Integration (Mobile Access)

Create a workflow that lets you chat with Claude Code from your phone via Slack:

#### Workflow Structure:

```
[Slack Trigger] → [Code: Generate UUID] → [SSH: Initial Claude Command]
                                                      ↓
                                              [Slack: Send Response]
                                                      ↓
                                              [Slack: Ask Continue?]
                                                      ↓
                                                [If Node]
                                               /        \
                                        [False]        [True]
                                           ↓              ↓
                              [Loop: SSH Resume]     [End Workflow]
                                      ↓
                              [Slack: Response]
                                      ↓
                              [Back to Ask Continue]
```

#### Key Components:

1. **Slack Trigger**: Listens for messages mentioning your bot
2. **Code Node**: Generates session UUID (see above)
3. **SSH Node (Initial)**: First Claude command with `--session-id`
4. **Slack Response**: Posts Claude's response back to channel
5. **Slack Dropdown**: "Are you done? [Yes] [No]"
6. **If Node**: Routes based on user selection
7. **SSH Node (Resume)**: Uses `-r --session-id` for follow-ups
8. **Loop**: Continues until user selects "Yes"

#### Example Prompts from Slack:

```
@bot deploy two agents to battle it out: which is better, nano or neovim?
Research, contrast, compare, give me a solid answer. Keep response under 2000 characters.
```

```
@bot use your NAS skill to check how my stuff server is doing
```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

### Claude Command Not Found

The SSH session may not load your shell profile. Solutions:

1. **Use full path:**
   ```bash
   /usr/local/bin/claude -p "your prompt"
   ```

2. **Source profile first:**
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc && claude -p "your prompt"
   ```

3. **Add to system PATH:**
   ```bash
   sudo ln -s $(which claude) /usr/local/bin/claude
   ```

### Permission Denied Errors

If Claude can't access files or run tools:

1. Ensure the SSH user has proper permissions
2. Use `--dangerously-skip-permissions` for tool access
3. Check file ownership in your project directories

### Session Not Resuming

Make sure you're:
1. Using the exact same session ID
2. Including the `-r` flag when resuming
3. Not letting too much time pass (sessions may expire)

### Response Too Long

Slack has a 4000 character limit. Add to your prompts:
```
Keep response under 2000 characters.
```

### SSH Connection Timeout

For long-running Claude operations:
1. Increase SSH timeout in n8n node settings
2. Consider breaking complex tasks into smaller prompts
